# github-testbed

This is sample project for testing various features of GitHub.
Rendering markdown is one of most notable things.
Others include:

1. Numbered lists like this one (this is items' first string)
  > Items may have text under the item text.
  > It's continued after new line with '>' character.

2. Links to files using relative to root directory paths
  > For example, [LICENSE](LICENSE).
  > Also, links may point to web resources, like [this one](https://github.com/)

3. Images (see below)
